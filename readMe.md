In first phase, packet re-transmission to sustain packet loss prevention issue and simulation was examined. However simulations were performed in very short intervals (in ms.), thus results were not acceptable. 
In final research phase, real implementation approach have been researched and TTN's "Fair Access Policy" have taken as guide.
Simulation parameters have been checked if it does fit or not with FAP. Then simulations have been performed. 
According to the simulation results, an application suggestion has been offered.

During this study simulations are performed on original ./loraDir.py simulation execution file. File testresult_part1 includes first simulation outputs, and testresult_part2 includes final work results.
